##Objective of my project
- I had to change the background image of the site as it was blur initially. I also added a favicon to the site.

##What task does it do? How did I implement that?
- I simply changed the url link of background image by adding another image to image folder. For favicon, I put up another link to the head tag of html with rel attribute set to "icon".

##My learnings from the project
- I learned how to change and add favicon. As a beginner to open source, i also learned a lot about several git commands.

##tech-stack
- I used javascript,css and html.
